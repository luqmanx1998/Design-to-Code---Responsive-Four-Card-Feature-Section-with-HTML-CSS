# Challenges faced :

This was yet another simple, yet time-consuming challenge that challenged my grid skills ! I did think of two different ways to do it, one with flexbox, and another with grid, but I opted to use grid because I thought it would be more fun, and I could improve my grid skills along the way ! 

Once again, this is a free challenge, so I had to eye-ball every spacing/margin etc, and that ended up taking me quite some time. I also learned how to use CSS pseudo elements to create line breaks [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/css-line-break-content-property), which helped me code this piece to match the design as much as possible, and I'm very happy with how it turned out ! On to the next one.
